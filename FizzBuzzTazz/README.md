## Part 1

You will be given a number. If number is divisible by 3, it's a Fizz ! If divisible by 5, it's a Buzz ! If divisible by 7, it's a Tazz !
Of course, results can be combined. For instance, 15 is a FizzBuzz.

## Part 2

Did I forget to mention 11 is a Mozz ?

## Part 3

Oh maaaan... I'm so sorry. Just remembered 13 is a Vezz...
